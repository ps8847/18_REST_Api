create                post
read                  get
update                put  ,  patch

rest api is statelessness

as per the rest artitecture , the server does not store any state about the client session on the server side . statelessness means that every http request happends in complete isolation. when the client makes an http request, it includes  all information necessary for the server to fulfill that request.
